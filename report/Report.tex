\section{Introduction}
In this practical, a forward checking constraint solver with 2-way branching is implemented. The implementation provides an interface to allow different heuristics for variable and value selection. To test the solver works as intended, problem instances of the N-queens, langfords and sudoku problems were generated and solutions created. Further, the performance of the solver and different heuristics are tested empirically using various metrics.
